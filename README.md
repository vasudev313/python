Syllabus- Regulation 2021

1. Identification and solving of simple real life or scientific or technical problems, and developing flow charts for the same. (Electricity Billing, Retail shop billing, Sin series, weight of a motorbike, Weight of a steel bar, compute Electrical Current in Three Phase AC Circuit, etc.) 

2. Python programming using simple statements and expressions (exchange the values of two variables, circulate the values of n variables, distance between two points). 

3. Scientific problems using Conditionals and Iterative loops. (Number series, Number Patterns, pyramid pattern) 

4. Implementing real-time/technical applications using Lists, Tuples. (Items present in a library/Components of a car/ Materials required for construction of a building –operations of list & tuples) 

5. Implementing real-time/technical applications using Sets, Dictionaries. (Language, components of an automobile, Elements of a civil structure, etc.- operations of Sets & Dictionaries) 

6. Implementing programs using Functions. (Factorial, largest number in a list, area of shape) 

7. Implementing programs using Strings. (reverse, palindrome, character count, replacing characters) 

8. Implementing programs using written modules and Python Standard Libraries (pandas, numpy. Matplotlib, scipy) 

9. Implementing real-time/technical applications using File handling. (copy from one file to another, word count, longest word)
